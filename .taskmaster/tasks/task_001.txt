# Task ID: 1
# Title: Environment Stabilization & Critical Bug Fixes
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve critical build issues including react-native-screens CMake errors and establish stable Android development environment on Windows
# Details:
Address immediate blocking issues preventing Android development progress. Focus on react-native-screens Windows compatibility, Android Gradle configuration, TypeScript setup, and build system stability following senior-level debugging methodology.

# Test Strategy:
Verify successful Android builds on Windows, confirm Metro bundler starts without errors, validate TypeScript compilation passes, test Android emulator connectivity

# Subtasks:
## 1. Verify Android Build Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test complete Android build process and resolve any remaining CMake/Gradle issues
### Details:
Run 'npx react-native run-android' and resolve any build failures. Verify that react-native-screens patches work correctly on Windows development environment.

## 2. Validate Metro Bundler Stability [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure Metro bundler starts reliably and handles hot reloading properly
### Details:
Test Metro bundler startup with 'npm start', verify hot reloading works, check for any bundling errors or warnings that could affect development workflow.

## 3. TypeScript Compilation & Linting Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure TypeScript compilation passes and code quality tools work correctly
### Details:
Run 'npm run type-check' and 'npm run lint' to verify all code quality checks pass. Fix any remaining TypeScript errors or linting issues.

## 4. Android Emulator Connectivity Test [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify Android emulator setup and app deployment works correctly
### Details:
Start Android emulator, deploy the app, test navigation between screens, verify that react-native-screens works without crashes. Document any emulator-specific configuration needed for Windows.

## 5. Document Environment Setup & Known Issues [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create documentation for Windows development setup and any workarounds
### Details:
Document the react-native-screens Windows compatibility fixes, list any required environment variables or configurations, create troubleshooting guide for future developers.
