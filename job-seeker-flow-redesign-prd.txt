# Job Seeker Flow Redesign - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Redesign the Job Seeker experience to improve usability, structure, and navigation. Ensure component responsibilities are clearly separated, add Instagram-style vertical navigation for job details, and revamp the application screen to reflect accurate user application data.

## Current State Analysis
The current implementation has several issues:
- PopularJobCard component is being misused across different screens
- Job browsing lacks proper vertical navigation
- Application screen shows job listings instead of application data
- Component responsibilities are not clearly separated
- Navigation flow between screens needs improvement

## Phase 1: Codebase Audit & Planning

### 1.1 Component and Screen Audit
**Objective**: Understand current implementation and identify issues

**Requirements**:
- Audit PopularJobCard implementation and usage across codebase
- Document all screens where PopularJobCard appears
- Analyze JobBrowserScreen structure (vertical vs horizontal orientation)
- Review JobDetailsScreen current UI layout and navigation
- Examine ApplicationScreen data display and component usage
- Identify improper reuse of job listing UI components

**Deliverables**:
- Complete audit report of current component usage
- Identification of misused components
- Documentation of current screen structures

### 1.2 Navigation & Data Flow Review
**Objective**: Map current navigation and data handling

**Requirements**:
- Map navigation flow between Job Listing → Job Details → Apply Flow
- Document how job data and application data are fetched, stored, and passed
- Identify global state management usage (Redux, Context API, Zustand)
- Understand loading states, cache, and pagination handling

**Deliverables**:
- Navigation flow diagram
- Data flow documentation
- State management analysis

## Phase 2: Redesign & Component Refactor

### 2.1 Job Listing Screen Redesign
**Objective**: Improve job browsing experience

**Requirements**:
- Retain horizontal layout for featured/popular jobs section
- Implement or confirm vertical scrolling for all jobs
- Ensure proper navigation to job detail screen
- Optimize loading performance for long job lists
- Improve UX for job browsing

**Deliverables**:
- Redesigned job listing screen
- Optimized performance for large job lists
- Clear separation between featured and regular jobs

### 2.2 Job Details Screen Enhancement
**Objective**: Implement Instagram-style vertical navigation

**Requirements**:
- Replace/enhance existing detail screen for vertical scrolling
- Implement swipe up for next job, swipe down for previous job
- Maintain current job interaction functionality (Apply, Save)
- Ensure smooth transitions and performance
- Define job preloading/fetching strategy for swipe navigation

**Deliverables**:
- Vertical swipeable job details screen
- Smooth transition animations
- Efficient job preloading system

### 2.3 Application Screen Redesign
**Objective**: Create dedicated application management interface

**Requirements**:
- Remove all job listing components from application screen
- Create dedicated application-specific UI components
- Display active applications with statuses
- Show application history (past jobs and outcomes)
- Implement tabbed navigation or clear distinction between current/past applications

**Deliverables**:
- Dedicated application management screen
- Application status tracking UI
- Historical application view

## Phase 3: Navigation & Integration

### 3.1 Navigation Structure
**Objective**: Ensure seamless navigation flow

**Requirements**:
- Update stack-based navigation for clean transitions
- Ensure correct data context for each screen
- Integrate swipeable navigation with navigation stack
- Maintain consistent navigation patterns

**Deliverables**:
- Updated navigation structure
- Seamless integration of swipe navigation
- Consistent navigation patterns

### 3.2 Data Flow Optimization
**Objective**: Centralize and optimize state management

**Requirements**:
- Organize state handling for job listings and selected job
- Centralize application statuses and metadata
- Manage user progress and scroll/swipe position
- Implement efficient data loading and caching strategy

**Deliverables**:
- Optimized state management
- Efficient data loading strategy
- Improved caching system

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation

### 4.1 Completion Criteria
**Requirements**:
- PopularJobCard used only on job listing screen for featured jobs
- Application screen shows only applied jobs with relevant data
- Vertical swipe navigation fully functional
- Seamless job browsing → details → apply flow
- All existing functionality preserved
- Clear component separation and modularity
- Clean and consistent navigation structure

**Deliverables**:
- Fully tested and validated implementation
- Documentation of navigation and data flows
- Performance validation

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Framework
- React Native with JavaScript (no TypeScript conversion)
- Maintain existing component structure where possible
- Use existing styling system and theme

### Performance Requirements
- Smooth 60fps animations for swipe navigation
- Efficient job preloading for seamless swiping
- Optimized rendering for large job lists
- Minimal memory usage for cached job data

### User Experience Requirements
- Intuitive swipe gestures (up/down for job navigation)
- Clear visual feedback for all interactions
- Consistent loading states and error handling
- Responsive design across different screen sizes

### Code Quality Requirements
- Clear component separation and responsibilities
- Modular and reusable components
- Comprehensive error handling
- Maintainable and well-documented code
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

## Success Metrics
- Improved user engagement with job browsing
- Reduced time to find and apply to jobs
- Better application tracking and management
- Enhanced overall user satisfaction
- Maintained or improved app performance

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 days (Audit and Planning)
- Phase 2: 5-7 days (Redesign and Refactor)
- Phase 3: 3-4 days (Navigation and Integration)
- Phase 4: 2-3 days (Testing and Validation)

Total estimated timeline: 12-17 days
